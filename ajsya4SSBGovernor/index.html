    <center><h1>ajsya 4 SSB Governor</h1>
      <p>Hello, my Scratch username is @ajsya and I want to be the Governor of ShopBux!</p>
    <h2>Why I should be your Governor</h2>
      <p>
        I should be the Governor of ShopBux because I am smart, kind, and I have ideas of how to change ShopBux for the better! 
        If you want to learn more about why you should elect me to be your Governor, read my speeches bellow!<br />
      </p>
    <h2>My Speeches</h2>
      <h3>Speech 1</h3>
        <p>
          Have you ever felt left out or that you don't have a voice? I'll make sure that everyone has a voice and that voting is fair for everyone. I know we have people all over the world in serval different time zones. We have people from New Zeland, the UK, Turkey, and the US. This will come in play when making decisions, that I will not enforce without YOUR opinion and I'll make it as fair as I can. Another problem? The economy is dead, there's really nothing that you can spend your ShopBux on besides on a few specialty shops. I'll change this by adding extra features that you can get by using your ShopBux. Now, I won't charge current free features but charge new features that I will add. This will help encourage workers at shops to do better quality work! Now we will really be a functioning program!<br />
        </p>
      <h3>Speech 2</h3>
        <p>
          If I was elected governor of ShopBux I would continue doing what a good employee would normally do, help customers and contribute to the success of ShopBux. I would accept Scratchers requests for an account or help them get an account if they are having trouble. I would contribute and monitor the wiki and website. And on top of this, I would add more features to ShopBux that would get the economy moving again and encourage workers and shops to complete orders faster and better. Now I guaranty that I have actual plans and that I'm just not making stuff up on the spot. I just don't want people to steal my ideas. And that's another thing, should we really be striking down our opponents? Is that really fair? I'll let you decide. And I promise you that I'll listen to your suggestions and make sure that you are okay with any executive decisions affecting your Shop(s), SSB, or whatever it is.<br />
        </p>
    <h2>The results</h2>
      <p>The election is curently underway so the results are not final but here is what the elimination period results are looking like right now! Feel free to vote for me!</p><br />

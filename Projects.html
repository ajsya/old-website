      Here are some of my projects and a history of them that I made with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" style="color: white">Scratch</a>!

      I consider this project my first "Real" project since that I made it without help from a book or anybody. 
      The goal of the game is to simply to get the monkey to the banananas as fast as you can using the arrow keys.
      But beware! Don't let the monkey touch the walls and watch out for his legs!

      Shortly after creating Monkey Maze! I began experimenting and tired to make a Pong Game. 
      Though I did use my book and used a few tutorials I think this project is important part of my history.
      To make the game begin press either 1 or 2. If you press one you control the paddle with your mouse and if you press 2 you control the paddle with the arrow keys.
      Be aware that this game is really buggy, and I'd like it to stay that way :)

    <h1>Space Drive</h1><br>

    <p>
      Space drive is another important game of my past where you control the rocket ship with your mouse and try to avoid asteroids and aliens.
      This game is also a little buggy.

    <p>
      This mobile friendly game translates statments into different langueges and reads them aloud. Click gobo to start translating :) 
      Please remember that this may not always be correct and that a person is better than a program.

    <p>
      In this project click the CD's (The round things at the bottom of the screen) to listen to variance songs. 
      A list of the songs can be found by clicking the clipboard.

    <h1>IKEA Chair Platformer</h1>
    <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/292201898/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
    <p>
      I made this platformer mostly for a joke (hint: listen to the music) but also because I saw other people making platformers and wanted to try it out.
      The backstory is that cats stole Mr. Ikea Chair's cookies and you have to get them back. (This is bassed on a joke fight against the CoR and ACC so you could say it's historic, kinda...)
      Use the arrow keys to guide the chair around lava to collect his cookies.
